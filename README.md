
Safety Monitoring based on Bayes might be preferred compared to a frequentist approach, because it is more conservative, i.e. when the true toxicity rate is high, the probability to stop/interrupt the trial is higher when using the Bayes criterion as programmed in this package.

To use the function, the number of patients in the arm as well as the critical toxicity rate, the critical posterior probability of unacceptable toxicity, the number of simulations, the assumed true toxicity rate used for the simulations and the 2 parameters for the Beta distribution (default: both set to 1) are needed.
